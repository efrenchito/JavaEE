1.Introducing JEE & Eclipse   
  Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)
   JEE is a collection of many different specifications intended to perform specific tasks.
   JEE specifications can be broadly classified in the following groups:
    PRESENTATION LAYER: 
     JEE specifications or technologies in this group receive the request from web server and send back the response HTML/JSON/XML.
     -> Servlets, JSP, JSF
    BUSINESS LAYER: 
     Handle the business logic of your application generally the request to this layer comes from 
     the Presentation Layer/Middle Layer (Web Services). 
     Classes in this layer are executed in application containers (GlassFish/WebSphere/Tomcat)
      ENTERPRISE JAVA BEANS: Are Java classes where you can write your business logic.
       EJB are not strict required but they provide many of the services that are essential 
       (security/transaction mgmt, component lookup, object pooling)
        -> Session Beans:
        -> Message Driven Beans: Java Messaging Service (JSM)
    ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION LAYER
      APIS in this layer are used for interacting with external (to JEE application) systems in Enterprise.
      Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
      The Java Persistence API (JPA)
      Java Connector Architecture
      Web Services  SOAP/REST
  
  Eclipse IDE
   (source control syste/build tools/file explorer/managing servers/database explorer/memory|cpu profiler)
   Along with editor support, Eclipse has plugins to interact with many of the external
   systems used during development. For example, source control systems such as SVN and
   Git, build tools such as Apache Ant and Maven, file explorer for remote systems using
   FTP, managing servers such as Tomcat and GlassFish, database explorer, memory and
   CPU profiler, and so on.  
   -> Workspace/Plugins/Editors and Views/Perspectives/Eclipse Preferences  
  Tomcat -> Don't Support EJB
   Tomcat is a Web Container. It supports APIs in the presentation layer, it also supports JDBC and JPA also. 
   ...
  GlassFish
   GlassFish comes in two flavors: Web Profile and Full Platform. 
   Web Profile is like Tomcat, which does not include EJB support. So download Full Platform
   %GLASSFISH_HOME%: 'C:\Program Files\glassfish-4.1.1\'
    -> Define ports: glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml
    -> Start server: glassfish/bin/glassfish/bin/startserv.bat
       index.html -> glassfish/domains/domain1/docroot/index.html
       => Go to Administration Console
  MySql
    Installing MySQL for Windows
      1.Accept License Agreement
      2.Select the Custom option and click on Next.
        Select... 
          MySQL Server 
          MySQL Workbench 
        ...and complete the installation.
      3.MySQL Server Configuration
          Config Type: Development Machine
          Connectivity: 
            TCP/IP  
            Port Number: 3306 
            [CHECK] Open Firewall por for network access
          Account and Roles: 
            MySQL Root Password: root
            Custom User: admin/admin
         -> Make sure you select All Hosts when adding a user so that you are able to access
            MySQL database from any remote machine that has network access to the machine
            where MySQL is installed.
    Creating MySQL users
     You can create MySQL user either the Command Prompt or by using MySQL Workbench.
      Command Prompt: 
        mysql -u root -p <root_password>
