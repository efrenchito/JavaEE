PART I. Introduction
    Chapter 1, "Overview"
     This chapter introduces you to Java EE enterprise application development. Here you will review development basics, learn 
     about the Java EE architecture and APIs, become acquainted with important terms and concepts, and find out how to approach 
     Java EE application programming, assembly, and deployment.
     The Java EE platform is developed through the Java Community Process (JCP), which is responsible for all Java technologies. 
     Expert groups composed of interested parties have created Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to define the various Java EE 
     technologies. The work of the Java Community under the JCP program helps to ensure Java technology's standards of stability 
     and cross-platform compatibility.
     The following topics are addressed here:
	    +Java EE 7 Platform Highlights
		  The Java EE 7 platform includes the following new features:
		  .New technologies, including the following:
		    -Batch Applications for the Java Platform
		    -Concurrency Utilities for Java EE
		    -Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P)
		    -Java API for WebSocket
		  .New features for EJB components
		  .New features for servlets (see Java Servlet Technology for details)
		  .New features for JavaServer Faces components (see JavaServer Faces Technology for details)
		  .New features for the Java Message Service (JMS) (see Java Message Service API for details)
	    +Java EE Application Model
	     The Java EE application model begins with the Java programming language and the Java virtual machine. The proven 
	     portability, security, and developer productivity they provide form the basis of the application model.
	     The Java EE application model defines an architecture for implementing services as multitier applications that deliver 
	     the scalability, accessibility, and manageability needed by enterprise-level applications. This model partitions the 
	     work needed to implement a multitier service into the following parts:
	      - The business and presentation logic to be implemented by the developer
		  - The standard system services provided by the Java EE platform
	    +Distributed Multitiered Applications
	     The Java EE platform uses a distributed multitiered application model for enterprise applications. Application logic is 
	     divided into components according to function, and the application components that make up a Java EE application are 
	     installed on various machines depending on the tier in the multitiered Java EE environment to which the application 
	     component belongs.
	       .Client-tier components run on the client machine.
		   .Web-tier components run on the Java EE server.
		   .Business-tier components run on the Java EE server.
		   .Enterprise information system (EIS)-tier software runs on the EIS server.
		 Java EE multitiered applications are generally considered to be three-tiered applications because they are distributed 
		 over three locations: client machines, the Java EE server machine, and the database or legacy machines at the back end. 
		 Three-tiered applications that run in this way extend the standard two-tiered client-and-server model by placing a 
		 multithreaded application server between the client application and back-end storage.
	    +Java EE Containers
	     The component-based and platform-independent Java EE architecture makes applications easy to write because business 
	     logic is organized into reusable components. In addition, the Java EE server provides underlying services in the form 
	     of a container for every component type.
	      -> Container Services
           Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level, platform-specific functionality that supports the 
           component. The assembly process involves specifying container settings for each component in the Java EE application 
           and for the Java EE application itself. Container settings customize the underlying support provided by the Java EE 
           server.
            - The Java EE security model
            - The Java EE transaction model
            - JNDI lookup services
            - The Java EE remote connectivity model
          -> Container Types
		   The deployment process installs Java EE application components in the Java EE containers
           The server and containers are as follows:
		    - Java EE server: The runtime portion of a Java EE product. A Java EE server provides EJB and web containers.
		    - EJB container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications. [Java EE server]
		    - Web container: Manages the execution of web pages, servlets, and some EJB components for Java EE applications. 
		        [Java EE server]
	 	    - Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components. [Client]
	        - Applet container: Manages the execution of applets. Consists of a web browser and a Java Plug-in [Client]
	    +Web Services Support
	     Web services are web-based enterprise applications that use open, XML-based standards and transport protocols to exchange data with calling clients. The Java EE platform provides the XML APIs and tools you need to quickly design, develop, test, and deploy web services and clients that fully interoperate with other web services and clients running on Java-based or non-Java-based platforms.
	      XML
		   Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a cross-platform, extensible, text-based standard for representing data. Parties 
		   that exchange XML data can create their own tags to describe the data, set up schemas to specify which tags can be 
		   used in a particular kind of XML document, and use XML style sheets to manage the display and handling of the data.
		  SOAP Transport Protocol
		   Client requests and web service responses are transmitted as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages over HTTP 
		   to enable a completely interoperable exchange between clients and web services, all running on different platforms 
		   and at various locations on the Internet. HTTP is a familiar request-and-response standard for sending messages over 
		   the Internet, and SOAP is an XML-based protocol that follows the HTTP request-and-response model. 
		  WSDL Standard Format
		   The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is a standardized XML format for describing network services. The 
		   description includes the name of the service, the location of the service, and ways to communicate with the service. 
		   WSDL service descriptions can be published on the Web. 
	    +Java EE Application Assembly and Deployment
	     A Java EE application is packaged into one or more standard units for deployment to any Java EE platform-compliant 
	     system. Each unit contains
		  - A functional component or components, such as an enterprise bean, web page, servlet, or applet
		  - An optional deployment descriptor that describes its content

		  provided in each chapter.
	    -> 2.6-Tutorial Example Directory Structure
	      Directory Structure
	       To facilitate iterative development and keep application source files separate from compiled files, the tutorial 
	       examples use the Maven application directory structure.

	       Each application module has the following structure:
			pom.xml: Maven build file
			src/main/java: Java source files for the module
			src/main/resources: configuration files for the module, with the exception of web applications
			src/main/webapp: web pages, style sheets, tag files, and images (web applications only)
			src/main/webapp/WEB-INF: configuration files for web applications (web applications only)

		  When an example has multiple application modules packaged into an EAR file, its submodule directories use the 
		  following naming conventions:
			example-name-app-client: application clients
			example-name-ejb: enterprise bean JAR files
			example-name-war: web applications
			example-name-ear: enterprise applications
			example-name-common: library JAR containing components, classes, and files used by other modules
	    -> 2.7-Java EE 7 Maven Archetypes in the Tutorial
	      Some of the chapters have instructions on how to build an example application using Maven archetypes. Archetypes are 
	      templates for generating a particular Maven project. The Tutorial includes several Maven archetypes for generating

PART II. Platform Basics
	Chapter 3, "Resource Creation"
	  A resource is a program object that provides connections to such systems as database servers and messaging systems. Java EE components can access a wide variety of resources, including databases, mail sessions, Java Message Service objects, and URLs. The Java EE 7 platform provides mechanisms that allow you to access all these resources in a similar manner. This chapter examines several types of resources and explains how to create them.
	  The following topics are addressed here:
		
		3.1 Resources and JNDI Naming
		 In the Java EE platform, the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) naming service enables components to locate 
		 other components and resources. Each resource object is identified by a unique, people-friendly name, called the JNDI 
		 name. For example, the JNDI name of the preconfigured JDBC resource for the Java DB database that is shipped with 
		 GlassFish Server is java:comp/DefaultDataSource.
		 
		 A resource object and its JNDI name are bound together by the naming and directory service. To create a new resource, a 
		 new name/object binding is entered into the JNDI namespace. You inject resources by using the @Resource annotation in 
		 an application.
		3.2 DataSource Objects and Connection Pools
		 To store, organize, and retrieve data, most applications use a relational database. Java EE 7 components may access relational databases through the JDBC API.
		 In the JDBC API, databases are accessed by using DataSource objects. A DataSource has a set of properties that identify 
		 and describe the real-world data source that it represents. (location, DB-name, network protocol, ...)
		 Applications access a data source by using a connection, and a DataSource object can be thought of as a factory for 
		 connections to the particular data source that the DataSource instance represents.

		 A DataSource object may be registered with a JNDI naming service. If so, an application can use the JNDI API to access that DataSource object, which can then be used to connect to the data source it represents.

		 Applications that use the Persistence API specify the DataSource object they are using in the jta-data-source element of the persistence.xml file:

		   <jta-data-source>jdbc/MyOrderDB</jta-data-source>

		 This is typically the only reference to a JDBC object for a persistence unit. The application code does not refer to 
		 any  JDBC objects. You can use a deployment descriptor to override the resource mapping that you specify in an annotation.
        3.3 Creating Resources Administratively
         Before you deploy or run many applications, you may need to create resources for them. An application can include a glassfish-resources.xml file that can be used to define resources for that application and others.

         Some of the JMS examples use this approach to resource creation. A file for creating the resources needed for the JMS simple producer example can be found in the jms/simple/producer/src/main/setup directory.
          asadmin create-jms-resource -> Create resources
          asadmin list-jms-resources  -> Display their names
          asadmin delete-jms-resource -> Remove those resources	
	Chapter 4, "Injection"
	  Java EE provides injection mechanisms that enable your objects to obtain references to resources and other dependencies 
	  without having to instantiate them directly. You declare the required resources and other dependencies in your classes by 
	  decorating fields or methods with one of the annotations that mark the field as an injection point. The container then 
	  provides the required instances at runtime. Injection simplifies your code and decouples it from the implementations of 
	  its dependencies.

	  The following topics are addressed here:

		4.1 Resource Injection
		  Resource injection enables you to inject any resource available in the JNDI namespace into any container-managed 
		  object, such as a servlet, an enterprise bean, or a managed bean. 
		    //field-based injection
		      public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
			      @Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultDataSource")
			      private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;
			      ...
			  }
			//method-based injection
			  public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
			      private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;
			      ...
			      @Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultDataSource")
			      public void setDsc(java.sql.DataSource ds) {
			          dsc = ds;
			      }
			  }
		
		  To use method-based injection, the setter method must follow the JavaBeans conventions for property names: The method name must begin with set, have a void return type, and have only one parameter.
		  The @Resource annotation is in the javax.annotation package and is defined in JSR 250 (Common Annotations for the Java 
		  Platform). Resource injection resolves by name, so it is not typesafe: the type of the resource object is not known at 
		  compile time, so you can get runtime errors if the types of the object and its reference do not match  
		4.2 Dependency Injection
		  Dependency injection enables you to turn regular Java classes into managed objects and to inject them into any other managed object. The container automatically provides instances of these dependencies at the injection points at runtime, and it also manages the lifecycle of these instances for you.
		  Dependency injection in Java EE defines scopes, which determine the lifecycle of the objects that the container 
		  instantiates and injects. You can define managed objects (also called managed beans) that you can later inject by 
		  assigning a scope to a regular class:

			@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
			public class CurrencyConverter { ... }
			
		  Use the javax.inject.Inject annotation to inject managed beans; for example:
			public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
			    @Inject CurrencyConverter cc;
			    ...
			}
		  As opposed to resource injection, dependency injection is typesafe because it resolves by type.
		4.3 The Main Differences between Resource Injection and Dependency Injection
		  Injection Mechanism	Can Inject JNDI Resources Directly	Can Inject Regular Classes Directly	Resolves By	  Typesafe
	      Resource Injection                 Yes                          No                            Resource name   No
	      Dependency Injection               No                          Yes                            Type            Yes
	Chapter 5, "Packaging"
	  This chapter describes packaging. A Java EE application is packaged into one or more standard units for deployment to any 
	  Java EE platform–compliant system. Each unit contains a functional component or components, such as an enterprise bean, 
	  web page, servlet, or applet, and an optional deployment descriptor that describes its content.

	  The following topics are addressed here:
	    5.1 Packaging Applications
	      A Java EE application is delivered 
	        in a Java Archive (JAR) file, a Web Archive (WAR) file, or an Enterprise Archive (EAR) file.
	      An EAR file contains Java EE modules and, optionally, deployment descriptors. A deployment descriptor, an XML 
	      document with an .xml extension, describes the deployment settings of an application, a module, or a component. 
	      Deployment information is most commonly specified in the source code by annotations. Deployment descriptors, if 
	      present, override what is specified in the source code.
	      A Java EE module consists of one or more Java EE components for the same container type and, optionally, one component 
	      deployment descriptor of that type. 
	        .EJB modules (.jar)
	        .Web modules (.war)
	        .Application client modules (.jar)
	        .Resource adapter modules (.rar)

		5.3 Packaging Web Archives
		5.4 Packaging Resource Adapter Archives

PART III. The Web Tier
	Chapter 6, "Getting Started with Web Applications"
	  A web application is a dynamic extension of a web or application server. Web applications are of the following types:
	   .Presentation-oriented:
	   .Service-oriented:

	  The following topics are addressed here:
	    + Web Applications
	      Web components can be Java servlets, web pages implemented with JavaServer Faces technology, web service endpoints,
	      or JSP pages. Servlets are best suited for service-oriented applications, JavaServer Faces and Facelets pages are 
	      generally used for presentation-oriented applications.
	      Web components are supported by the services of a runtime platform called a web container. 
	      A web container provides such services as request dispatching, security, concurrency, and lifecycle management.

	      Certain aspects of web application behavior can be configured when the application is installed, or deployed, to the web container. The configuration information can be specified using Java EE annotations or can be maintained in a text file in XML format called a web application deployment descriptor (DD)
		+ Web Application Lifecycle
		  The process for creating, deploying, and executing a web application can be summarized as follows:
			Develop the web component code.
			Develop the web application deployment descriptor, if necessary.
			Compile the web application components and helper classes referenced by the components.
			Optionally, package the application into a deployable unit.
			Deploy the application into a web container.
			Access a URL that references the web application.

				    Best Practices
					 -> Minimize the amount of scriptlets and declarations code in a JSP
					 -> Avoid dumping thousands of lines of code in JSP
					 -> Refactor this into a separate Java class ... make use of MVC

  @3.Creating Your First Java EE Application
  This chapter gives an overview of the example applications and step-by-step instructions on coding and running the dukes-age web service example application.
  
  + 3.1 Architecture of the Example Applications
    The example applications consist of four main components:
	. DukesAgeResource, a JAX-RS RESTful web service:
	  - Resource that calculates the age of Duke, the Java mascot.
	    Duke was born May 23, 1995, when the first demo of Java technology was publicly released.
	
	. DukesBirthdayBean, an enterprise bean:
	  - Is a local, no-interface view stateless session bean that calculates the difference between the user's age and Duke's age and stores 
	    the user-submitted data in a Java Persistence API entity.

	. FirstcupUser, a Java Persistence API entity:
	  - Represents a particular user's birthday. It is stored in a Java DB database table and managed by DukesBirthdayBean's business methods.

	. Firstcup-war, a web application created with JavaServer Faces Facelets technology.
	  + Accesses DukesAgeResource to display Duke's age, reads in a date provided by the user, accesses DukesBirthdayBean to calculate who is older, 
	    and then displays the difference in years between the user and Duke and the average age difference of all users.

		The firstcup-war web application consists of the following:
		- greeting.xhtml: A Facelets-enabled XHTML page, which is a page that uses the JavaServer Faces Facelets tag libraries. Users can type their birth date in a field and submit it for comparison against Duke's birth date.
		- response.xhtml: A Facelets-enabled XHTML page that tells the user whether he or she is older or younger than Duke, based on the date the user entered in the greeting.xhtml page, and displays the average age difference of all users.
		- DukesBDay.java: A CDI managed bean that defines properties to hold the user's birth date, uses the JAX-RS Client API to get Duke's current age from the DukesAgeResource web service, and calculates the age difference between the user and Duke from the enterprise bean.
		- web.xml: The web application's deployment descriptor, which is used to configure certain aspects of a web application when it is installed. In this case, it is used to provide a mapping to the application's FacesServlet instance, which accepts incoming requests, passes them to the life cycle for processing, and initializes resources. It also specifies greeting.xhtml as the welcome file for the application.
		- WebMessages.properties and WebMessages_es.properties: Java programming language properties files that contain the localized strings used in greeting.xhtml and response.xhtml. By default, the English language strings in WebMessages.properties are used, but Spanish language strings are also provided in WebMessages_es.properties.
		- DukesBirthdayBean.java: as described above, the enterprise bean packaged within the firstcup-war application. DukesBirthdayBean calculates the difference between the user's birthday and Duke's birthday.

	  3.1.2 Tiers in the Example Applications
		- WEB Tier Component: The firstcup-war web client.
		- BUSINESS Tier Component: The DukesAgeResource web service, the FirstcupUser entity, and the DukesBirthdayBean enterprise bean.
		- ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEM(EIS):  The data in the Java DB database table
		- CLIENT Tier Component: The user's web browser is the client tier component, as it accesses the rest of the application through the web tier.
	  
	  3.1.3 Java EE Technologies Used in Example Applications
		- JAX-RS: The DukesAgeResource web service
		- STATELESS SESSION BEAN: The DukesBirthdayBean enterprise bean.
		- Java PERSISTENCE API: The FirstcupUser entity
		- CDI bean The DukesBDay uses the JAX-RS client API to access the DukesAgeResource web service.
		- The firstcup-war web client is a JavaServer Faces application that runs in the web container of the Java EE server.
		
  3.2 Coding the dukes-age Example Application
    3.2.1 Getting Started
	  - Register the server with your NetBeans IDE as described in Configuring Your Environment.
      + Install the Maven archetypes used to create the example applications.
		. There are two archetypes included in the example, dukes-age-archetype and firstcup-war-archetype.
		  -> In NetBeans IDE 
			File>Open Project: 
			C:\glassfish4.1.1\docs\firstcup\example
			Right-click the firstcup project in the Projects pane and select Build.
	
	3.2.2 Creating the Web Service
	  The DukesAgeResource endpoint is a simple RESTful web service. 
	  RESTful web services are web-based applications that use the HTTP protocol to access, modify, or delete information contained within a resource.
	  A RESTful web service resource is a source of specific information identifiable by a uniform resource identifier (URI), 
	  for example http://example.com/someResource, and may be manipulated by calling the HTTP protocol's methods, for example GET or POST.
	  
	  3.2.2.1 JAX-RS Resources
	  The basic DukesAgeResource resource class is generated from the dukes-age-archetype Maven archetype. 
	  This class is annotated with the javax.ws.rs.Path annotation, which specifies the URL suffix to which the resource will respond. 
	  DukesAgeResource has a single method, getText, annotated with the javax.ws.rs.GET and javax.ws.rs.Produces annotations.
	  . @GET marks the method as a responder to HTTP GET requests
	  . @Produces specifies the MIME-type of the response sent back from getText to clients. In this case, the MIME-type is text/plain.
	  
	  3.2.2.2 Creating the dukes-age Application Using the Maven Archetype
	  In NetBeans IDE:
	  File>New Project
	  Category: Maven
	  -> Project from Archetype
	    Click Next
		-> Search: dukes-age
		In the Known Archetypes field, select dukes-age-archetype.
		Click Next
		  Project Name: dukes-age
		  Package: firstcup.dukesage.resource
		  Click Finish
		  
		  The dukes-age-archetype archetype creates the structure of the JAX-RS endpoint application, including:
		  . The DukesAgeResource resource class
		  . The web.xml deployment descriptor
		  Now is your turn to configure how the application will run, implement the functionality of the resource class, and then deploy the application.
		  
		  
		  -> Configure the dukes-age Web Application
		  Set the default URL that is brought up in a web browser when you run dukes-age.
		  Right-click on dukes-age project/Properties
		    Click on Run node
			-> Set Relative Url to: '/webapi/dukesAge'
			
		  -> Within the dukes-age Project:
  		     Expand Source Packages node
			   then double-click the com.oracle.ipm.dukes.age.DukesAgeResource.java and replace current code in getText with the following code:
			   
				// Create a new Calendar for Duke's birthday
				Calendar dukesBirthday = new GregorianCalendar(1995, Calendar.MAY, 23);
				// Create a new Calendar for today
				Calendar now = GregorianCalendar.getInstance();

				// Subtract today's year from Duke's birth year, 1995
				int dukesAge = now.get(Calendar.YEAR) - dukesBirthday.get(Calendar.YEAR);
				dukesBirthday.add(Calendar.YEAR, dukesAge);

				// If today's date is before May 23, subtract a year from Duke's age
				if (now.before(dukesBirthday)) {
					dukesAge--;
				}
				// Return a String representation of Duke's age
				return "" + dukesAge;
		  
		  Start Glassfish Server through Services tab
		  -> Both the database server and the GlassFish Server instance will start.
		  
		  Building and Deploying the Web Service Endpoint
		  -> Build dukes-age project
		     Then Right-click Run
  			 
  @4.Creating Your Second Web Application
    The firstcup-war example application consumes the data from the dukes-age web service using the JAX-RS client API. 
    A JavaServer Faces web front end asks users to enter their birthdays to find out who is older, the user or Duke. 
    This data is stored in a Java DB database table using the Java Persistence API. 
    The business logic, which provides the core functionality of the application, is handled by an enterprise bean.
    
    4.1 Creating the firstcup-war Project
    4.2 Modifying the Java Persistence API
    4.3 Modifying the Enterprise Bean
    4.4 Modifying the Web Client
    4.5 Building, Packaging, Deploying, and Running the firstcup-war Web Application
